# AI_POWERED_REAL_TIME_EYE_BLINK_DETECTION_AND_LOGGING-
“A real-time computer vision project that detects and logs eye blinks using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The system applies facial landmark detection and Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to classify eye states (open/closed) and records events with timestamps in CSV format for data science analysis, drowsiness detection, and behavioral monitoring.”
